# React Functional Component Library - V0.0.1

Define an interface & re-use forever!

A 'plug and play' react functional component library to reduce programming time by handling server-sided state management for a given interface.

This is currently just a passion project of mine to get into the world of open source development, and become a better developer in the process. I am making functional components based on my own personal experience to help myself & others bring react code to production faster. Aka spend more time on layouts than managing your state!

Why build this?
I often found more component-based libraries for react and had to often craft my own solutions for managing state. This project is a combination of my ambition and expertise within React to build a project

## FormBuilder

FormBuilder is a functional component that handles ALL state management of an interfaced object.

It will generate a form field that you can use to create or edit an object! Will also have the ability to hook up to create and update endpoints 

It is must useful for in-line or modal/dialog based creation of objects. 


## Roadmap

#### FormBuilder:
- Hook up to CRUD based endpoints for creation, deletion, and update of a given interface

- Callback function on submission to update or refresh a list of entities.

- Custom layouts ??

#### FormFields
- Support for date pickers, multi select, select,

- Server sided rendering options

- Create/define custom FormFields that are configurable for complex-nested objects 


#### CRUDEngine - TBD
- TBD / Designed

#### ServerSidedLists - TBD
- A simple functional component to handle pagination / filtering / sorting states with overrites 

- Handle new/updates/deleting of internal entities.
