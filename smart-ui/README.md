# React Functional Component Library

A 'plug and play' react functional component library to reduce programming time by handling state management. 

This is currently just a passion project of mine to get into the world of open source development. I am making functional components and uses based on my own personal experience to help developers bring react code into production faster.  

Have feature requests/questions? Feel free to message me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brendan-young-357a8720b/)! I will try to get back to you
## FormBuilder
